The codes and datasets for the paper (under review) "Detecting anomalies in heterogeneous data using fuzzy granule density".

## Abstract
Outlier detection aims to find objects that behave differently from the majority of the data. Existing unsupervised approaches often process data with a single scale, which may not capture the multi-scale nature of the data. In this paper, we propose a novel information fusion model based on multi-scale fuzzy granules and an unsupervised outlier detection algorithm with the fuzzy rough set theory. First, a multi-scale information fusion model is formulated based on fuzzy granules. Then we employ fuzzy approximations to define the outlier factor of multi-scale fuzzy granules centered at each data point. Finally, the outlier score is calculated by aggregating the outlier factors of a set of multi-scale fuzzy granules.
